# Angular Snake Xenzia

The end goal of this project is to emulate the Snake Xenzia game as seen on
the Nokia X1 phone.

So far this project was initiated using the [Angular quickstart seed](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html). It then incorporates
a canvas as demonstrated in the [angular2-canvas-examples project](https://github.com/sflahave/angular2-canvas-examples).

Install and run with:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

After the `npm start` you should see:
